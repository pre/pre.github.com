<div class="entry-content"><p>I took a new Lumia 800 to a test for two weeks. During this period I used Lumia 800 as my primary phone. I wanted to answer the following question:</p>

<blockquote><p>If I prefer an iPhone to a Lumia, what are the three most important problems for me in Lumia 800?</p></blockquote>

<p><img class="right" src="http://salainen.asia/images/lumia-steve-small.jpg" width="260"></p>

<p>My first two mobile phones were Nokia 3110 and 6110. That was when Nokia still ruled in the mobiles! My very last Nokia was a Symbian E75 smartphone which I had in 2009. That Nokia phone already felt quite incompatible with the Internet, so I soon switched to Android. Now I have used an iPhone after the release of iPhone 4 in 2010.</p>

<p>Since I live in Finland, I&#8217;m interested in the whereabouts of Nokia. Only two days ago <a href="http://yle.fi/uutiset/nokia_vahentaa_suomesta_3_700/6180987">Nokia laid out 3700 employees in Finland</a> (the biggest layoff in Finnish history) and announced shutdown of significant factories in Finland and Germany. <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/15/samsung-apple-walk-away-with-90-percent-of-smartphone-profits-in-q1-2012-says-abi-research/">According to TechCrunch</a> and senior ABI analyst Michael Morgan, “at this point in the year, Nokia will have to grow its Windows Phone business 5000% in 2012 just to offset its declines in Symbian shipments.” So Lumia should better kick some ass! (And have at least the following TOP-3 problems solved.)</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Internet already has a wide selection of <a href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/04/the-nokia-lumia-900-a-good-phone-at-a-great-price-that-you-probably-shouldnt-buy/">reviews</a> and <a href="https://www.google.fi/search?q=Lumia+vs+iPhone+4">Lumia vs iPhone 4</a> articles. This is not one of them. Instead, I merely wanted to write down my own thoughts so I can refer to them later when I will test the next generation Lumias with Windows 8.</p>

<h2>TOP-3 Problems</h2>

<p>My TOP-3 of Problems are mostly related to Windows Phone as a platform. I don&#8217;t know how much fixing these is in the hands of Microsoft, and how much Nokia could do about them. I would really want to see a serious third player in the market mobile platforms which is currently dominated by iOS and Android. I wish Nokia will not only end up as Microsoft&#8217;s bitch, but have a stand on the issues regarding its very own future.</p>

<h3>1. Calendar &amp; Contacts: Unreliable synchronization.</h3>

<p>Synchronization of calendar and contacts with Google was easy to setup, but Lumia&#8217;s synchronization features cannot be trusted at all. Sync between Google Calendear and Lumia&#8217;s calendar cannot be manually forced and there is no way to be sure that your appointments have been synced with Google &#8211; often they are not.</p>

<p>During the first days of usage this seemed to be just a little hiccup, but soon it became clear that Lumia is never fully synchronized with Google Calendar. Whenever I needed to view my calendar, I picked up my iPhone since I could not trust Lumia showing all my appointments.</p>

<p>Delegated calendars are not supported either. In addition to my personal calendar, I need my work calendar and it is also handy that my wife has given me read access to her calendar. Both are delegated to my personal Google account. Lumia supports only the one primary calendar of a Google account &#8211; there is no way to access delegated calendars. <a href="http://support.google.com/mobile/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=139206">Delegated calendars need some setup</a> for iPhone, but it seems that Lumia is out of luck with this one.</p>

<p>Another problem are the contacts in Lumia&#8217;s address book. When I create a new contact in &#8220;Google directory&#8221;, the contact gets created in Lumia, but it will not be propagated immediately to Google. Also, new contacts created in Google are not visible in Lumia, and there is no way to manually initiate the synchronization. This feels awkward, since the Lumia is constantly unsynchronized and I ended up with contacts and calendar data which are only available locally in Lumia.</p>

<h3>2. Application ecosystem: Apps feel immature.</h3>

<p>At the moment it seems that most mobile applications launch first with a polished iOS app, and an Android app follows as a little brother. For the time being many popular or novelty applications are not available in Windows Phone&#8217;s Marketplace. This will probably change after the Windows Phone platform matures, but for the time being many third party Windows Phone applications seem to have more bugs than their iOS versions.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.evernote.com">Evernote</a> is probably the one third-party application I use the most on iPhone. However, the Windows Phone version has several issues which degrade its usability. Some of them are so clear (and annoying), that I wondered if anyone actually uses Evernote on a Windows Phone. Description of the bugs is at the end of this post.</p>

<p>The need for Facebook Messenger surprised me. I had not realized the volume of instant messages which are sent to me via Facebook. Whenever I grabbed my iPhone, FB Messenger told me I have new messages. I did I know about them while using Lumia because I did not regularly check my Facebook account. On iPhone, instant messages from FB Messger are delivered to you in the same way as SMS text messages, so you don&#8217;t need to open the Facebook application in order to check messages.</p>

<p>This problem boils down to a classical dilemma: A platform needs users to get applications, but on the other hand the platform needs applications to get users.</p>

<h3>3. Internet Explorer: Incompatibility issues.</h3>

<p>Lumia&#8217;s browser blows in comparison to Webkit based browsers in Android and iOS. Some web pages look only visually broken, but some pages don&#8217;t work at all. Some sites show you a mobile version from the Symbian dark-ages (even Gmail) or show you the desktop site even though a mobile site is available. There is no copy paste, Javascript based pages feel slower than with Webkit and I couldn&#8217;t have IE to save passwords.</p>

<p>Knowing the past history of Internet Explorer, these problems are not about to change, unless developers actually start testing their web site with a Windows Phone. And that requires that there are much more Windows Phone users in order for developers to care.</p>

<p>Side note: I probably could get used to Bing as the Lumia&#8217;s default search engine &#8212; if only the browser was better.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Lumia 800 is a decent smartphone, but it is two or three years behind its rivals. The physical form and design of the device feels excellent and the gadget looks beautiful. I know people who even <em>love</em> their Lumia, however, Lumia has usually been the first smartphone for them.</p>

<p>I liked the overall experience, but Lumia 800 gave me the same feeling of incompleteness which I had with Android-based Samsung Spica in 2010. My goal was to find out what exactly is the problem for <strong>me</strong> to use the Lumia 800 instead of an iPhone 4. In addition to the TOP-3 problems described above, I also collected <a href="/blog/2012/06/19/details-from-lumia-800-test-drive/">details from the test drive</a>. Most of them are personal opinions which won&#8217;t make a difference for me until the TOP-3 problems listed in this post are gone.</p>

<p>With these issues, Lumia will not help <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/15/samsung-apple-walk-away-with-90-percent-of-smartphone-profits-in-q1-2012-says-abi-research/">Nokia to grow its sales by 5000% this year</a>. Lumia is a good choice for people who don&#8217;t want much from their smartphone software or who don&#8217;t use much mobile internet. But why would one buy a Lumia 800 for the same price (~400 €) when they can spend the same amount of money for an Android device? Even the three-year-old iPhone 3GS (370 €) seems a viable choice instead of Lumia 800.</p>
