Dealing against negativity in an argumentative manner will only result in more negativity. It does not even matter whether you are arguing in a positive or a negative manner.

[According to Peter Bregman](http://blogs.hbr.org/bregman/2012/09/how-to-respond-to-negativity.html), a much more productive response is to respond negatively *with* others and positively *with* them.

The difference is more than semantic.
