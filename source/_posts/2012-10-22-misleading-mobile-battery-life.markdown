Nowadays it seems irrelevant to ask: "How long does the battery last in my smartphone?"

<!-- more-->
iPhone 5 draws much more power than iPhone 4/4S, but [it completes the same benchmark set much faster](http://www.anandtech.com/show/6330/the-iphone-5-review/12). Thus, in a long-term benchmark iPhone 5 has a better battery life than its predecessors, because iPhone 5 is able to go to sleep quicker and therefore reduce its power consumption.

However, since people use their device more if they don't need to wait, ie. software is more responsive, the "battery life" feels weaker. On the other hand, they were able to achieve more in the same time of usage.

In general, comparing devices only by hardware specs is so last season. The answer to the smartphone's battery life question is "one day" regardless of the hardware, manufacturer or device model.
