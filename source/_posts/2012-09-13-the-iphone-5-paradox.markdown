iPhone 5 is currently the most advanced smartphone and, paradoxically, a [really boring](http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/09/the-iphone-5-is-boring-and-amazing/) new product announcement. By comparing only the hardware specs even the new Nokia Lumia phones may compete. But the devil is in the software.

Last summer I test-drove Nokia Lumia 800, Samsung Galaxy Nexus and Samsung SII. In general these were all decent smartphones with Lumia having smoother usability than Android, but Android beating Lumia in applications. In the end, I wanted to change back to iPhone from all these devices, mostly because of seamless user experience and superior application ecosystem of iOS.

By looking only at the specs and appearance, I would love Lumia 920. However, I just can't get over the fact that Internet Explorer is a crappy mobile browser (too many websites appear as broken) and software in Windows Phone's app marketplace lose to their Android and iOS counterparts. Comparingly in Android I always feel wary whether clicking a button will actually do what it looks like since there is no consistent paradigm in the user interface.

It is a trap to run a comparison such as "iPhone vs. Android". It's like comparing oranges and apple juice. Anrdoid is an ingredient for juice (an operating system) and iPhone is the juice (a mobile phone). Whenever you encounter a comparison between eg. iPhone and Samsung Galaxy S3, you should ask yourself whether you are thinking the phone as a whole (iOS/Android operating system, app ecosystem, the device hardware) or only the cold numbers in a technical spec sheet.

If I wasn't so used to the latte of Apple's baristas, the regular coffee of Android cafeteria would taste quite good.

Edit: iPhone 5 pre-order [sells out 20 times faster than 4 and 4S](http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/14/iphone-5-pre-order-sells-out-20x-faster-than-4-and-4s-further-highlighting-apples-dominance/), but [Apple will soon need to revolutionize in a new industry](http://pandodaily.com/2012/09/13/yesterday-marked-the-beginning-of-the-end-of-apples-dominance-unless/) (eg. televisions) since the mobile revolution has stabilized down to evolution.
