The author of [Bootstrapping Design](http://bootstrappingdesign.com/) self-published his book, and therefore, he kept control over how the sales and customer relations should be handled. The author, Jarrod Drysdale, wrote a [retrospective about the lessons learned](http://blog.studiofellow.com/2012/05/31/30k-ebook-sales-in-2-months/). One particular thought got my attention:

> I made an honest mistake after launch. The coupon I had promised everyone on my mailing list expired before I said it would.
>
> I reactivated the coupon, extended the expiration by an extra week, and sent an email to the list apologizing. This apology email drove about $1,200 in sales. Other newsletters have not converted quite so well.

In other words: tell your customers that you screwed up and proactively offer a refund, coupon or something nice. The gesture will likely pay itself back.

PS. The price of $39 is high for an ebook, but the goal was [more money from fewer sales](http://blog.asmartbear.com/higher-pricing.html). When targetted to the right audience, the price does not feel too much even though the book's font-size is large, almost every other page has pictures and the content fits in 150 pages. The author did something right since the book collected a revenue of $30,000 in two months.

If I would ever write a book, I would [self-publish it](http://techcrunch.com/2012/01/28/why-every-entrepreneur-should-self-publish-a-book/).
