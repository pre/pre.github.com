A vulnerability in Java SE allows a complete Java security sandbox bypass. Nevertheless, Oracle decided to stick to its semi-quarter patch release cycle and promised a security fix in February 2013. That is almost five months from now.

[Adam Gowdiak et al. challenge Oracle](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2012/Oct/155): they claim that this particular security fix does not require any integration tests with other Oracle application software, needed only 25 characters to be changed and was implemented within 30 minutes.

The culture of Oracle is damaging. It is not acceptable to delay a critical security fix for almost five months because of an enterprise process of "semi-quarter patch release schedule". Oracle has [also delayed security fixes before](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/08/30/oracle_knew_about_flaws/).

It is no coincidence that [Apple has removed Java browser plugin](http://www.engadget.com/2012/10/18/apple-removes-java-from-osx/) from all OS X browsers and Java is no longer pre-installed in OS X.
