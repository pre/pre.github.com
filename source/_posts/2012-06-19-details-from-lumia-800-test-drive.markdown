In addition to the TOP-3 problems from my Lumia 800 Test Drvice, I collected a set of details. These issues are not actual deal killers, but since there are a lot of the small issues, the general usability is degraded.

These details won't make a difference without the bigger picture, so please read [the list of TOP-3 problems
](/blog/2012/06/18/nokia-lumia-800-test-drive/) first.

First impressions with Lumia
----------------------------

- Design of the physical device feels especially comfortable in your hand.
- Scrolling and graphical effects are fluent, display feels bright.
- Setup of synchronization for contacts and (one) calendar was easy! (However, [it wasn't working properly.](/blog/2012/06/18/nokia-lumia-800-test-drive/))
- Some web pages look weird
- This is my first phone since 2005 which displays text messages from SIM card. I did not remember I even had those. I was surprised to see messages from an ex-girlfriend. :)  In the old times text messages were stored in the SIM card and there was a limit of keeping max 20  messages at once.
- This is my first Nokia where the clock is easy to access when the keypad is locked.
- Lumia has about the same physical size, dimensions and weight than an iPhone.
- Everything in the UI seems to be scrollable in any direction (up-down & left-right).
- There is no way to take a screenshot!
- Software update is found instantly after the first boot, but updating requires a computer and a Microsoft's Zune software. Nokia's download link first sent me a Windows version so I needed to specifically search for the OS X version.
- "Battery saver" is a good feature which is not available in iPhone. When needed, as a battery saver I have switched off 3G and cellular data. However, new versions of iOS have disabled switching off the 3G network.


Features I would like to have:
------------------------------


### Screen resolution comparable to a Retina display.
The Lumia display is pretty sharp, but on the other hand, the font in native applications is usually fairly large. Sharpness of the display is needed in web browsing when text in non-mobile optimized websites is usually quite small. You will see the difference if you open any non-mobile optimized site (which you will often get with Internet Explorer) and compare it between Lumia's AMOLED and iPhone's Retina display. The small text is readable and very sharp with iPhone's Retina display but blurry in Lumia.


### Internet tethering.
This is fundamental when you take your laptop and want to work outside your office. This could be compensated with a 3G USB-modem. However, I have used the iOS Personal Hotspot feature in so many surprising situations that I guess I would never have a separate USB dongle with me should I need an ad-hoc internet connection.

There is a rumor that tethering will come available by a software update, but it was not available yet as of June 2012.


### Software Updates for the Windows Operating System

Neither Microsoft nor Nokia has stated that current Lumia devices (running WP7) will get an update to WP8 which is about to be released during the autumn 2012. Rumours are actually quite the opposite: [Current Lumia devices might never get an update to WP8.](http://www.zdnet.com/blog/microsoft/reading-between-the-lines-office-on-ipad-windows-phone-upgrades/12101)

In contrast, iOS devices have gotten updates to the new operating system. iPhone 4 (released in 2010 with iOS 4) will get an update to iOS6, and probably even iPhone 3GS will work with iOS 6.



### Wireless streaming of music (such as Airplay).

I stream music wirelessly from Spotify to Airport Express which is plugged into my stereos. iOS devices support that natively, but on the desktop, I need to use a third-party application called Airfoil. There could be a third-party application for Windows Phone which could do the same. However, I don't know if it's technically possible because of application sandboxing or security restrictions.

During the test it became clear that I have already invested in different pieces of Apple hardware for several years.



### MMS messages.
I could't receive MMS messages. I don't know why, but they just don't load. When I receive a new MMS, Lumia displays a link "Get media content now". When I click it, Lumia tells me it is loading the content, but then it just fails silently, does not display any error message and I don't see the MMS message. A Google search revealed that this is a common problem.



### Online backups.

I don't need to worry losing my photos should I lose my iPhone. Lumia must be backupped manually, which I would probably remember to do once a month -- maybe.



Minor Details
-------------

### If you have used Apple's iMessages before..

If you have ever activated iMessages on your iOS device, you need to explicitly disable iMessages. Otherwise your friends with iPhones, in the worst case, can't send you text messages at all. In a happy case or there is only a long delay. I did not run statistics, but there were several messages I never actually received because friends' iPhone did not fallback from iMessage to SMS.

The technical reason seems to be that iPhone tries to send you iMessage first, and it fallbacks to regular SMS only after a significant delay. According to my experience, most text messages from friends using iPhone couldn't get through at all before I disabled iMessages completely. This might have something to do with the fact that I had a multi-sim in my iPhone which was connected to the network with the same phone number than Lumia. Lumia had the primary sim card for SMS messages, though.

(iMessage is Apple's instant messaging system which works like SMS but without usage costs).



### Hardware and the Physical Device
<!-- - Although Lumia's display (800x480) loses to iPhone's retina (960x640) in sharpness, Lumia's picture quality is still very good. - Native applications usually have a large font which makes the display feel small. The display doesn't usually show lots of text at once, which means that you need to scroll the views more often than with a sharper display.
-->
<!-- - I was not used to hardware buttons (back, search, camera). -->

There is no hardware button for silencing the ringer volume. You need to click lock-screen button and then hold down the volume button until it's value is 0/20. To get ringer back, you need to hold the button until it's value is XX/20. Unless you pay attention to this, the ringer volume will usually always reach the maximum (20/20) -- there is no way to configure presets or have a fast-access silencer for ringer volume.

The hardware buttons for volume up/volume down are not easily accessible during call. I accidentally tried to lower the volume several times from the camera button since it feels the same as the adjacent camera button. I was never sure if I had the right button, sometimes I accidentally muted the whole call since I did not hear the difference in the volume and I was not sure whether I was pressing the camera button.

The hardware search button is reserved for a global internet search using Bing. When an application provides a search function, there is a software button which usually looks the same as the hardware button. Some applications place the software search button right on top of the hardware search button, which looks weird.

The battery lasts about the same amount of time as iPhone -- both phones need to be charged every night if you use them for anything. During the test iPhone's standby time surprised me, it was five days in my bag without a recharge (because I did not use it).

 -->



### Camera

You can start the camera application from the hardware button even if your phone is locked. This may be disabled, but then you don't have a camera shortcut. I kept this enabled, but somehow I accidentally launched the camera application several times only by holding the device in my hand.

For an accidental camera launch to happen, the lock button must be pressed once before the camera button is pressed. But this is easy to do by accident because both buttons are physical and both are located on the same side of the phone. (For the record, iOS camera shortcut is from a software button which does not react in your pocket.)




### User Interface in General

Moving the cursor on the screen is a daunting task. iOS displays a small spyglass which helps you to place the cursor the same way as you select the place for the cursor by clicking. Lumia displays a help cursor, but moving it feels unintuitive. You need to try this by yourself to understand.

Many applications use 1/4 of the screen for a header which is placed on top of the screen (eg. Facebook). This makes the screen appear tight, that is, the header eats the space which could be used for displaying the actual content.

Instead of a context aware software back button, there is a swipe left/right navigation system. For example in Evernote you navigate by swiping left from Notes to Notebooks. In the iOS version, you navigate back to Notebooks from a software back button. However, in Lumia, if you click hardware back button it exists the application instead of going back to "Notebooks" from "Notes". Maybe application developers have not yet understood the "Metro Way" of UI design, but currently many WP applications have confusing navigation.

You can't see when an application is synchronizing. I don't know whether WP7 applications can handle their sync tasks in the background. Therefore I am not confident to lock the screen and put the phone in my pocket before I know that the synchronization is done. On the other hand, my calendar never got synchronized reliably so what can you do. (When an iOS app synchronizes, a spinner is displayed next to the carrier information on top of the screen.)

Sometimes touch events are interpreted incorrectly. For example, when scrolling downwards, the downward movement stops and the screen gets scrolled a little bit upwards. That is, when I lift my finger from the screen, a swipe-up event is registered although I did not want to swipe up. This happened very often when I browsed Facebook laying on bed or a sofa. This has not happened to me on iOS.



### Calendar (in addition to the high priority issues)

- Default reminder!!! I don't want to set any reminders, but all new calendar events will get a reminder set 15 minutes before the event. You need to disable these one-by-one, there is no default setting you could change. This is annoying, since I don't want any calendar beebs at all.

- Moving between dates feels cumbersome. You can't get to next/previous day by swiping left/right, instead you need to scroll a longer listing up/down. This feels dumb if you want move several days at once.

- Synchronization issues and lack of delegated calendars, see top of this post.

- There is no weekly view, only daily and monthly views. It is hard to get an overview of a whole week.

- Calendar shows current events in lock screen. This cannot be disabled. I did not like this feature at all, as I don't like text message previews in lock screen either.





### Evernote

- You need to choose "edit" two times and then you need to save your text two times. Why?

- When you write text which is longer than available space, your newly-written text goes under the keyboard. Has anybody actually written anything longer than "asdfasdf" in the WP app?

- You can't get an empty line between text paragraph. There is just no way. Your text will be a one long paragraph.

- Application gets often jammed if I switch between Internet Explorer and Evernote (e.g. when reading a web page and writing a memo at the same time).

- Somehow Evernote doubled the contents of one note. Another synchronization issue.

- These are clear and very-easy-to-spot kind of bugs which make me wonder whether anybody actually uses Evernote on a Windows Phone.



### Nokia Transit

In Helsinki public transport you can't use Nokia Transit for: "Leave on the third stop after Mannerheimintie." You can't view the bus route, you can only view the walking routes. This means that you don't know which bus stops in the map are for your bus in the suggested route. Nokia Transit supports several cities around the world, but in Helsinki, it loses brightly for ReittiGPS (an iOS app for Helsinki).

I understand that Nokia wants to be international and stuff, but they have blasted for years how they are a Finnish company. Therefore I would have expected that the Finnish Flagship of Navigation would do well in their home ground.


### Youtube

You can't freely move the position in a video. The app provides arrow buttons which will skip 30 seconds per click. How to skip 15 seconds?



Summary
-------

The appearance of Lumia is amiable, the external design of the device feels enjoyable, but the software is full of small issues which degrade usability. The Windows Phone as a platform seems to be some years behind its rivals iOS and Android. The question remains: Why would someone use the same amount of money (~ 400 €) to buy a Lumia instead of an Android? Even the three-year-old iPhone 3GS (370 €) seems a viable choice instead of Lumia 800.
